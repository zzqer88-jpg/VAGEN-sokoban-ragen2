"""VAGEN's trainer customisations, as mixins over verl's ``_fit_*`` hooks.

Replaces the vendored copy of ``verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py``. Rationale: v0.8.0's
``SeparateRayPPOTrainer`` breaks ``RayPPOTrainer``'s 410-line monolithic ``fit()`` into
~20 small ``_fit_*`` hooks, so our changes can be overrides instead of a fork -- and the
same mixin then composes with ``OneStepOffRayTrainer`` / ``FullyAsyncTrainer`` for free.

Two layers on purpose:

* ``VagenLogicMixin`` -- what we do. Bound to no verl method name, so migrating to
  verl main's V1 ``PPOTrainer`` (``on_step_end`` etc.) means rewriting only the layer
  below, not the logic.
* ``VagenV0Mixin`` -- where it hooks into v0.8.0's ``_fit_*``.

★ Placement matters. ``fit_step`` runs:

    _fit_compute_advantage -> _fit_update_critic -> _fit_update_actor
      -> _fit_dump_data -> _fit_validate -> _fit_save_checkpoint
      -> _fit_collect_metrics -> _fit_experimental

value_mask, custom metrics and filtering all belong *between* advantage and
update_critic, so all three hang off ``_fit_compute_advantage``'s tail. In particular
the filter must NOT go on ``_fit_experimental``: that runs after the actor update, so
filtering there would train on the unfiltered batch and then discard the result.
